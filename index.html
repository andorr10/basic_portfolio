		<h1>About Me</h1>
		 <img src="assets/images/aorr_headshot.jpg" > 
		I don't know if you know this, but Andrew Orr is kind of a big deal.  Many people know him. He is very important.  He has many leather bound books and his apartment smells of rich mahogony.
		<b></b>
		All dwarfs may be bastards yet not all bastards are dwarfs. A Lannister always pays his debts. Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen? No one turns away a Lannister. Don't fight for a king. Don't fight for his kingdoms. Don't fight for honor, don't fight for glory, don't fight for riches, because you won't get any.
